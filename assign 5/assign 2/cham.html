    <p>Chamcham, an oval-shaped brownish variety of chomchom from Porabari in Tangail District of modern-day Bangladesh, dates back to mid-19th century. The unique taste has been attributed to the water in Porabari. Jagadish Mishtanno Bhandar in Khustia District makes a version known as Maowar Chomchom.</p>
