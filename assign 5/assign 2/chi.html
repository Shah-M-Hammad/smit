    <h1>Chicken Chowmin</h1>
    <img src="https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/221013_Chicken-Chow-Mein_1.jpg">
    <p>Chow mein is a traditional Chinese dish made with egg noodles and stir-fried veggies. We love adding a protein and our favorite is chicken, but you can try different meat or tofu. This dish is pan-fried so the noodles get a nice crisp to them and then tossed in a yummy sauce.</p>
